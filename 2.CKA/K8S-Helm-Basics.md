# K8S - Helm Basics

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications. It’s similar to tools like apt for Debian or yum for CentOS, but for Kubernetes.

Helm is a tool that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of applications on Kubernetes. Often described as a package manager for Kubernetes, it uses Helm charts—pre-configured templates that manage Kubernetes resources. This abstraction allows practitioners to deploy applications with a single Helm command, reducing the heavy lifting required in managing YAML files and kubectl commands.
