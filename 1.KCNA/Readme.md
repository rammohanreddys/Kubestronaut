## Cloud Native Architecture Fundamentals
**Characteristics of Cloud Native Applications:**

Cloud Native Applications harness the power of the cloud to provide increased resilience, agility, operability, and observability. Let's dive a bit deeper into these characteristics.

**Resiliency:**

Resilient applications are designed to withstand failures and continue to function or recover quickly. They typically make use of patterns such as redundancy, failover, and graceful degradation. Self-healing, where systems automatically detect and recover from failure, is a key aspect of resilient cloud-native applications. Kubernetes, for instance, has a built-in self-healing mechanism where it maintains a desired number of pod replicas and replaces failed instances.

**Agility:**

Agility in the context of cloud-native applications refers to the ability to quickly build, modify, and deploy applications. Agile practices such as microservices and continuous delivery pipelines, backed by automation, promote rapid iteration and responsiveness to change.

**Operatability:**

Operability encompasses the ease of deploying, running, and managing applications. Cloud-native applications are designed to be easily monitored, configured, and maintained. They typically leverage automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to streamline operations and minimise toil.

**Observability:**

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of your system based on the outputs it generates. It's a critical component in diagnosing issues and understanding how an application behaves in the wild. Logging, monitoring, and tracing (collectively known as the 'three pillars of observability') are vital practices to understand the state and performance of cloud-native applications.

## Key Pillars of Cloud Native Architecture

Building upon the characteristics and practices discussed, cloud-native architecture is sometimes referenced as being founded on four key pillars:

**1. Microservices Architecture**

Microservices architecture involves breaking down the application into loosely coupled, independently deployable components, each focusing on a single responsibility. This design enables agility, scalability, and resilience as each microservice can be developed, scaled, and managed independently.

**2. Containerisation**

Containerisation involves encapsulating an application with its dependencies into a container, which can run uniformly across different environments. It facilitates isolation, consistency, and efficiency, making applications easier to build, deploy, and manage.

**3. DevOps**

DevOps is a collaborative approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and speed of software delivery. By fostering a culture of excellence, DevOps emphasises automation, monitoring, and collaboration across development and operations teams.

**4. Continuous Delivery (CD)**

Continuous Delivery is a practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. CD accelerates the release cycle, enhances productivity, and reduces the risk, complexity, and downtime of application deployment.

In essence, building cloud-native applications is a strategy that promotes agility, resilience, operability, and observability by leveraging modern technological practices.

With a clear understanding of these characteristics and key pillars, organisations can fully exploit the advantages of cloud-native architectures.

## Autoscaling:

Autoscaling is a fundamental feature of cloud-native architecture that enables applications to automatically adjust their computing resources based on demand. Here's a clear breakdown of what it is, why it matters, and how it works in a cloud-native context:

**What is Autoscaling in Cloud-Native Architecture?**

Autoscaling refers to the automatic adjustment of resources‚Äîlike virtual machines, containers, or pods‚Äîbased on metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, queue length, or custom business metrics.

**Why Autoscaling Is Important**

**Improves Performance:** Ensures your application can handle spikes in traffic or workload.
**Reduces Cost:** Scales down resources during low demand, reducing operational costs.
**Enhances Resilience:** Maintains availability and responsiveness during failures or high loads.
**Supports Elasticity:** Key to cloud-native elasticity, where apps are dynamically responsive to demand.

## Serverless
Serverless is a modern cloud computing model that perfectly fits within cloud-native architecture. It allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers, letting cloud providers handle infrastructure, scaling, and availability.

### ‚úÖ What is Serverless?
In a serverless architecture, you write functions or services, and the cloud provider runs them on-demand. You are charged only for execution time, not idle time.

### üß± Core Characteristics of Serverless in Cloud-Native Systems:

|Feature  |Description|
|:---------|:------------|
|Event-driven|Functions are triggered by events (e.g., HTTP requests, database changes, message queues).|
|Auto-scaling|Instantly scales up/down based on demand, without manual intervention.|
|Pay-per-use|You‚Äôre billed only for function execution time and resources used.|
|Stateless|Functions are typically stateless; state is managed via databases or external storage.|
|Managed infrastructure|Developers focus on code; the provider handles servers, patching, scaling, etc.|

### üß© Where Serverless Fits in Cloud-Native Architecture:
Serverless is one of the pillars of cloud-native development, alongside:

* Microservices
* Containers
* DevOps & CI/CD
* APIs

#### It promotes:

üèóÔ∏è Modular applications (functions for each task)

üöÄ Rapid development and deployment

üîß Operational efficiency
